# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to anagram-app. These are just guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgement and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Getting Started

Please follow installation and how to use on main [README](https://github.com/ShinyVerse/anagram-app/blob/master/README.md).

## Issue
Please check first if the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/ShinyVerse/anagram-app/issues). If bug hasn't been reported please open a [new issue](https://github.com/ShinyVerse/anagram-app/issues/new).

### Write detailed information
Detailed information is very helpful to understand an issue.

For example:
* How to reproduce the issue, step-by-step.
* The expected behaviour (or what is wrong).
* Screenshots for GUI issues.


## Pull Requests
Pull Requests are always welcome.

1. When you edit the code, please run `rspec` to check all tests are still passing and run `rubocop` to check the formatting of your code before you `git commit`.
2. Ensure the description clearly describes the problem and solution.
